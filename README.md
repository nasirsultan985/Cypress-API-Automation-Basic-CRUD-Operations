# ðŸš€ Cypress API Automation - Basic CRUD Operations  

## Project Overview  
This repository contains a **basic API automation project using Cypress** for performing CRUD operations on the [Restful Booker API](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/).  

The purpose of this project is to help **beginners** understand how to automate API testing using Cypress **without setting up a full framework**.  

---

##  What You Will Learn  
-  How to send API requests using Cypress (`cy.request()`).  
-  Performing CRUD operations on a REST API.  
-  Handling authentication and authorization in API testing.  
-  Validating API responses using Cypress assertions.  
-  Implementing negative test cases for security validation.  

---

## Test Cases Overview  
The test suite covers the following scenarios:  

### **CRUD Operations:**  
1. **Create Booking** â€“ Creates a new booking and stores the booking ID.  
2. **Fetch Booking Details** â€“ Retrieves and verifies the details of the newly created booking.  
3. **Get All Bookings** â€“ Fetches all existing bookings from the API.  

### **Negative Test Cases:**  
4. **[Negative] Update Booking Without Authorization** â€“ Attempts to update a booking **without authentication** (Expected: `403 Forbidden`).  
5. **[Negative] Delete Booking Without Authorization** â€“ Tries to delete a booking **without authentication** (Expected: `403 Forbidden`).  

### **Authentication & Authorized Actions:**  
6. **User Authentication** â€“ Logs in with valid credentials and retrieves an authentication token.  
7. **Update Booking with Authorization** â€“ Updates the booking details using **authentication**.  
8. **Delete Booking with Authorization** â€“ Successfully deletes a booking using authentication.  
9. **Verify Deletion** â€“ Ensures that the deleted booking is **no longer accessible** (Expected: `404 Not Found`).
